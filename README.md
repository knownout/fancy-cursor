Custom animated cursor for websites
Cursor automatically changes color depending on the color of the element it is pointing to.
Adding an element to the variable "--cursor" allows you to change the cursor. Two variations are available: text and pointer.
Cover is turned off when a text field, input or contenteditable div is hovering and focusing.
